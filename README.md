Weekly Meal Planning App

	This simple web application helps you plan your meals for the week. Users can choose the dishes they want to prepare during the week, and the app will display a meal plan for each day. There is also an option to generate a shopping list and print the meal plan.

How does the app work?

	The app uses a list of available dishes and allows the user to select the ones they want to prepare for the week. Then, the app creates a meal plan for each day of the week and displays it to the user. Additionally, users can generate a shopping list that contains the products needed to prepare the selected dishes. They can also print the meal plan for easier reference throughout the week.

How to use the app?

	Open the web page containing the app.
Select the meals you want to prepare for the week.
Press the "Zapisz i pobierz" button.
The app will display a meal plan for each day of the week and print.
		
Technologies

	The app is written in JavaScript. In the future, there are plans to switch to React, which will allow users to edit the meal plan.
